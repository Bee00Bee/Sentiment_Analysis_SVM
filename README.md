# Sentiment_Analysis with SVM

### Introduction
In this project, you will learn to pre process the sentences in natural processing language (NLP). For this purpose the dataset includes tweets
and it has positive and negative tweets. Then we predict the sentiment of the tweets from strings and labels. It is a supervised learning approach
which we split the data into test and train.

### Required packages:
* [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
* [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
* [tokenizer](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html)
* [skelrean packages](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
  * [SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)
  * [Train Test split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html)

The dataset is avaible from nltk.
